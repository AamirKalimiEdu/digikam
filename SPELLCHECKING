Note:   I have created this list after I did spell checking on some sourcecode
        folders. I will redo everything from start.

        Maybe you want to help spell checking our sourcecode?
        You can do so using those commands in one of those folders. Don't run
        them under the main digiKam root, if you don't want to sit in front of aspell
        all day :-)

            find -type f -iname "*.cpp" -exec aspell check -x --mode=ccpp {} \;
            find -type f -iname "*.h" -exec aspell check -x --mode=ccpp {} \;

        Normally you are able to combine those commands, but then somehow aspell
        will only scan the header files:

            find -type f -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" -exec aspell check -x --mode=ccpp {} \;

        Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but find will list both filetypes, but
        aspell doesn't care.

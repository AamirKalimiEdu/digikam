------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* post conversion to qlistview: allow selection of multiple 
  albums/tags/dates
   - instead of a "current album" there will a list of 
     "current urls"
   - will lead to widesweeping changes all over the core
     and the kioslaves

* Custom ordering of images [TA]

* remove thumbnail size from the settings [TA]

* resizable thumbnail in comments tag editor?

0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Image Properties SideBar:

   - update ImagePropertiesMetadataTab on ImageAttributesWatch's signalFileMetadataChanged
     (ImageAttributesWatch is libdigikam, the metadatatab is used by showfoto - create subclass
      ImagePropertiesMetadataTabDB?)

* Showfoto: 

   - In SlideShow with fullscreen mode enable, the vertically oriented image automaticily rotated using
     Exif tags are toggle on to save when SlideShow is complete.

* ICC workflow: 

   - Something is broken in ICC workflow if ICC profile repository set in digiKam configuration have 
     been deleted. There is no test at startup to check this point.
   - When editor ask to user if we need to process ICC workspace profile to an image if there is no embedded
     profile, add the capability to save current workspace in image without processed color correction. All 
     JPEG image for example are already corrected in sRGB without embedding a profile.
   - ICC image plugin: check the ICC profiles type for each sections (Monitor/Workspace/Input/Proof) when 
     user choose profile file manually.

* ImageEditor:

   - SavingAs record the temp image file created in database. At the next session of digikam, the file is identifed like removed from collection!
   - Polish keyboard focus in sidebar when navigate between album pictures.

* Main Interface:

   - Finalize IPTC keywords tags parsing to create new digiKam tags in database when new images are imported.



* B.K.O files to fix :

* Media support:

       o Make media menu, cmdline option and dcop call itentical:
               + usbdisk camera: dcop call should magicly umount as cmdline
                 option and Media menu
       o download dialog when opened via dcop do
               o goto desktop digikam is currently running, and unminimize and
                 put on top
       o CRASH: with 2 download dialog
               digikam --detect-camera         # don't close download dialog
               dcop digikam-<pid> camera cameraAutodetect # dialog open with error; closing
                                                       the dialog ==> CRASH

    o Testing 3 plug cases (camera is here gphoto _and_ usm)
        1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
            -> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
               be in the list. 
        2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
            -> as 1) but already instance should be used
            (uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
            if necessary
        3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
           camera is already connected
            -> camera menu allows to 
                select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
                to start download dialog
                ditto for unmounting in usm case

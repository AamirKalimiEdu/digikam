* split albumfolderview into albumview and tagview
   - also port albumview and tagview to qlistview [JA]
   - add dnd stuff to the base class and derived classes [JA]
   - add dnd to albumfolder view [JA]
   - add context menu [JA]
     - edit album properties
     - delete album
     - import
     - batch
     - duplicate images

* allow user to edit dates (maybe through comments tag editor) [TA]

* fix changing of album library path. [TA/RR]

* handle files/folders being added/deleted
  - kdirwatch is in place in albummanager. add directory scanning
    support to digikamalbums kioslave and use it to scan in new
    items (this should take care of all cases: camera files being
    downloaded, users adding files/folders from outside digikam)

* search view and search table in database
  - extended search dialog 
        - i18n missing

* fix saving of curent state of digikam 
  - splitter sizes
  - active view
  - closed/open state of left/right views
  - currently selected albums in each view

* find a safe and clean solution for dialogs/views which access items
  in the albumiconview (the properties dialog, comments editor,
  image viewer). If the items get deleted while the dialog box is open,
  since these dialogs hold pointers to the items, an easy crash is the
  result

* Fix PPC compatibility in image filters [GC]
* Use threaded implementation in image filter when it's possible [GC]
* Add doxygen comments in libs implementation [GC]
* Update handbooks [GC/GK]
* Add 'Zoom In/Out' capabilities with ImagePreviewWidget (like in Photoshop (tm)) [GC]
* CD/DVD album folders+database backup/restore tool [GC]

Post 0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* post conversion to qlistview: allow selection of multiple 
  albums/tags/dates
   - instead of a "current album" there will a list of 
     "current urls"
   - will lead to widesweeping changes all over the core
     and the kioslaves

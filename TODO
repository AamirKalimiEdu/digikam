               + usbdisk camera: dcop call should magicly umount as cmdline
                 option and Media menu
       o download dialog when opened via dcop do
               o goto desktop digikam is currently running, and unminimize and
                 put on top

               digikam --detect-camera         # don't close download dialog
               dcop digikam-<pid> camera cameraAutodetect # dialog open with error; closing
                                                       the dialog ==> CRASH

   - Better embbeded thumbnail support, especially for TIFF/EP ?
   - Improved metadata from TIFF file format. Add DNG file format if it's possible...
   - Improved PNG file format support : PNG vs DNG file format : PNG is the ultimate photographs data container in OpenSource world ?

* post conversion to qlistview: allow selection of multiple
  albums/tags/dates :

   - instead of a "current album" there will a list of 
     "current urls"
   - will lead to widesweeping changes all over the core
     and the kioslaves

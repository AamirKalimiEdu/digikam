0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Media support
       o Make media menu, cmdline option and dcop call itentical:
               + usbdisk camera: dcop call should magicly umount as cmdline
                 option and Media menu
       o download dialog when opened via dcop do
               o goto desktop digikam is currently running, and unminimize and
                 put on top
       o CRASH: with 2 download dialog
               digikam --detect-camera         # don't close download dialog
               dcop digikam-<pid> camera cameraAutodetect # dialog open with error; closing
                                                       the dialog ==> CRASH

* Image Properties SideBar:

   - Added signal/slots control between IE and main interface about "comments & tags" tab.
     Comments & tags set from main must be updated in IE and vise-versa.
     
* post conversion to qlistview: allow selection of multiple
  albums/tags/dates :

   - instead of a "current album" there will a list of 
     "current urls"
   - will lead to widesweeping changes all over the core
     and the kioslaves

* Custom ordering of images

B.K.O files to fix :

==> 118501  (Image Editor:   Exif lost when modifying the images)
==> 94362   (CameraGui:      read only on the fly option)
==> 115423  (Main Interface: thumbnails view jumps to top when new photos are added)
==> 119741  (Image Editor:   restore image editor if already open)

==> 111446  (Image Editor:   bad behaviour when out of disk space)
==> 114241  (Main Interface: image comments encoding unreadable after moving an album)
==> 120053  (Main Interface: whatthis info not closed when albumview is scrolled)
==> 120241  (Main Interface: utf8 display and edit)

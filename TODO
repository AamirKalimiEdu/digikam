0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* right hand side sidebar (allee):
	o Select an album 
        o click on some empty space in the thumbnail view (-> selected image changes from blue selection
          background to dotted line (aka still has keyboard focus, right?)
        o Now select tabs in right hand side:
		+ Properties, metadata..: everyhing is disabled
		+ comments/tags tab on the other hand  shows info about the image with keyboard focus
        Shouldn't every tab show now it's info in this case? (alternatively disable comments/tags too)

* ImageEditor:

   - Polish keyboard focus in sidebar when navigate between album pictures.


* B.K.O files to fix :

==> 127179 : Main interface : thumbnails does not adhere to the Rotate Images setting in Configure digiKam.
==> 113797 : Main interface : Little thumbnail refresh problem. 
==> 121804 : Main interface : Image overwritten with blank file when importing into same folder.

* Media support:

    o Testing 3 plug cases with GPhoto camera
        1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
            -> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
               be in the list. 
        2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
            -> as 1) but already instance should be used
            (uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
            if necessary
        3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
           camera is already connected
            -> camera menu allows to 
                select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
                to start download dialog
                ditto for unmounting in usm case

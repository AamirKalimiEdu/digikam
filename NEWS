digiKam 5.6.0 - Release date: 2017-05-07

NEW FEATURES:
Database    : We activated database shrinking for MySQL as part of the maintenance since now we can test the affected tables for integrity.
Searches    : Users can now restrict the results of fuzzy image/drop/sketch search to be in specific albums.
Searches    : Users can now select both tags and albums in duplicates search and restrict the set of images in which duplicates are searched with logical operations (in selected albums or/and tags, in selected albums but not tags and vice versa and only in selected objects of current tab)
Searches    : In extended search, the tags selection can also be restricted such that images must be either tagged with at least one of or with all selected tags.

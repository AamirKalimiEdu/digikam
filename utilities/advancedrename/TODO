TODO list for AdvancedRename utility
------------------------------------

Parsing:

    - Do not parse modifier tokens when they are placed incorrectly.
      Right now they are inserted as normal text, but it would be better to completely remove them from the parsed name.

    - Try to detect faulty rename pattern strings. In this case, deactivate the rename dialog's OK button.

Syntax Highlighting:

    - Be smarter when detecting parameters. Right now we need to make sure that the first matching group
      in the RegExp contains the parameters. But sometimes it is not possible to enclose the parameters with
      the first matching group.

Modifiers:

    - ReplaceModifier: Add RegExp support

    - UniqueModifier:  - Add parameters to the tooltip (after string freeze is over)
                       - Auto-detect needed digits (I already have something in mind, but it might not be added due to
                         the string freeze

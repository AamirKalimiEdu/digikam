TODO list for AdvancedRename utility
------------------------------------

Syntax Highlighting:

    - Be smarter when detecting parameters. Right now we need to make sure that the first matching group
      in the RegExp contains the parameters. But sometimes it is not possible to enclose the parameters with
      the first matching group.

Modifiers:

    -CaseModifier:     - Remove LowerCase, UpperCase and FirstLetterModifier and merge them in a CaseModifier.
                         This has actually been done already in a local branch, but I can't commit it due to the
                         string freeze. Just merge it into trunk after string freeze is over.

    - ReplaceModifier: Add RegExp support

    - UniqueModifier:  - Add parameters to the tooltip (after string freeze is over)
                       - Auto-detect needed digits (I already have something in mind, but it might not be added due to
                         the string freeze

ADDING NEW OPTIONS:

Just copy the 'dummyoption' class in here and change it to your needs.
A little explanation has been added to the class.
Take a look at all the other option classes to see how they work.

After you implemented your new rename option, you need to register it with one of the parsers.
Right now only one parser exists, it is called 'DefaultRenameParser' and can be found in
'utilities/advancedrename/parser/'

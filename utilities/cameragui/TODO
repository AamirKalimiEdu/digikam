Camera Icon-view port to Qt4 Model/View port
============================================

For 2.1.0, a lots camera interface code have been cleaned to reduce depencies to Qt3 support class which still used in icon-view.
This code must be ported to Qt4 model-view. Code relevant of this are listed below :

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/entry/utilities/cameragui/items/cameraiconitem.h
https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/entry/utilities/cameragui/views/cameraiconview.h

... which use these parents classes based on Q3ScrollView : 

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/show/utilities/cameragui/q3support

Indirectly this class is also relevant of future model/view port :

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/entry/utilities/cameragui/views/cameraiconviewtooltip.h

For all of this, we have already classes of icon-view based on Qt4 model-view in digiKam core. There are used in AlbumGUI:

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/show/libs/widgets/itemview

Here, you will find models, used to populate and filter icon view:

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/digikam/repository/revisions/master/show/libs/models

But of course, these models are based on database and cannot be used in camera interface. They must be re-written...

The goal of model-view port is to be able to :

- factorize a lots of code shared with album gui.
- remove Qt3 dependency
- create more powerful icon-view for camera interface, with advanced filtering option, group of items (RAW+JPEG), pre-tags options, etc...
- To be able to use preview mode in camera interface (image + video), as in albumgui.

Notice to make release tarballs from SVN
----------------------------------------

1/ In first, backup old ChangeLog file to ChangeLog.old.

2/ Create a fresh ChangeLog file using svn2cl script. Just run it from main digiKam root directory. In issue, please check if ChangeLog file is updated properly.

svn2cl can be dowloaded at this url: http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/
Just copying this tarball content on digikam root directory to use it.

Nota : svn2cl need xstlproc program. Please install it before.

3/ Copied last changes of fresh ChangeLog file to ChangeLog.old using a simple text editor. Place a release tag to the front on ChangeLog.

4/ Renamed ChangeLog.old to ChangeLog and commit it on svn.

5/ Fixed release info in these files and commit it on svn :
   - digikam/version.h
   - digikam/digikam.lsm

6/ Edited release_digikam.rb script. Fixed these settings :
   - version
   - svnbase

Nota : docs must be set to 'no' because documentation must be packaged in a separed tarball to reduce source code tarball size.

7/ Run release_digikam.rb script

8/ When tarball is created, decompress it in a temp folder and tried to compile it to prevent any problems.

9/ Upload tarball on digikam3rdparty.free.fr area via ftp and post a message on digikam-devel@kde.org mailing list to have a feedback from pakagers before to post an offical release.

10/ When official tarball is ready to post, don't forget to copy current trunk svn branch to tags branch (http://websvn.kde.org/tags/digikam/)

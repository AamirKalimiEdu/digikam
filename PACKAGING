Notice to make release tarballs from SVN
----------------------------------------

1/ Update the release info in these files and commit it to svn :
   - digikam/version.h
   - digikam/digikam.lsm

2/ Edited release_digikam.rb script. Update these settings :
   - version.
   - svnbase.
   - addPo (for example addPo = ["showfoto"] if showofoto is include in digikam tarball).
   
Note : docs must be set to 'no' because the documentation must be packaged in a separate tarball to decrease the source code tarball size.

3/ Commit changed files to svn.

4/ Backup old ChangeLog file to ChangeLog.old.

Just copying this tarball content on digikam root directory to use it.

Note : svn2cl need xstlproc program. Please install it before.

6/ Copy last changes of fresh ChangeLog file to ChangeLog.old using a simple text editor. Place a release tag at the top of ChangeLog.

7/ Renamed ChangeLog.old to ChangeLog and commit it on svn.

8/ Run release_digikam.rb script.

9/ When tarball is created, decompress it in a temp folder and try to compile it to prevent any problems.

10/ Upload tarball to digikam3rdparty.free.fr area via ftp and post a message on digikam-devel@kde.org mailing list to have a feedback from pakagers before posting an offical release annoucement.

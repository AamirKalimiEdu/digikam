0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 16 bits/color/pixels support : Any Image plugins must be udapted. Current port status is listed below :

   > Already done plugins:

   - Adjust Curves    : Done.
   - Adjust Levels    : Done.
   - Anti Vignetting  : Done.
   - Blowup           : Done.
   - Channel Mixer    : Done.
   - Free Rotation    : Done.
   - Inpainting       : Done.
   - Refocus          : Done.
   - Restoration      : Done.
   - Shear Tool       : Done.
   - Solarize         : Done.
   - White Balance    : Done.


   > Pending plugins (by difficulty order):

   - Add Border       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Oil Paint        : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Texture          : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Blur FX          : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Distortion FX    : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Film Grain       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Lens Distortion  : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Rain Drops       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Infrared         : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits (similar to FilmGrain. Can be long.
   - Emboss           : TODO. ==> The algorithms must render embossed image in color, not in B&W (like krita).
                                  Can be long.
   - Hot Pixels       : TODO  ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. This part will be done by Unai Garro. 
                                  Add manual hot pixel selection. Need to implement pixel selection on
                                  imageregionwidget from digikam core. Can be long
   - Insert Text      : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Fix plugin to support multiText edition 
                                  in a same session (see B.K.O). Can be long.
   - Perspective      : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Separate class to compute Matrix. 
                                  Check why antialiasing filter don't give any effects. Can be long.
   - Superimpose      : TODO. ==> complete rewrite of plugin widget (See B.K.O file). Can be long.
   - Noise Reduction  : TODO. ==> backport new algorithm from Krita based on wavelets (it's better). Can be long.
   - Charcoal         : TODO. ==> backport algorithm from kimageeffect and add 16 bits support. 
                                  Get any inspiration from sharpen algorithm already backported from kimageeffect
   - Unsharp          : TODO. ==> backport new algorithm from ImageMagick (it's better). Can be long.

Nota : 

- For all pending plugins, we need to use new standard dialogs from digikam core instead common dialog from DigikamImagePlugins.  

- All common dialog from DigikamImagePlugins must be removed.

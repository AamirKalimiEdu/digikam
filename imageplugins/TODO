0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 16 bits/color/pixels support : Any Image plugins must be udapted. Current port status is listed below :

   > Already done plugins:

   - Adjust Curves    : Done.
   - Adjust Levels    : Done.
   - Anti Vignetting  : Done.
   - Blowup           : Done.
   - Channel Mixer    : Done.
   - Free Rotation    : Done.
   - Inpainting       : Done.
   - Refocus          : Done.
   - Restoration      : Done.
   - Shear Tool       : Done.
   - Solarize         : Done.
   - White Balance    : Done.


   > Pending plugins:

   - Blur FX          : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Add Border       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Charcoal         : TODO. ==> backport algorithm from kimageeffect and add 16 bits support. 
                                  Get any inspiration from sharpen algorithm already backported from kimageeffect
   - Distortion FX    : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Emboss           : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Film Grain       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Hot Pixels       : TODO  ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. This part will be done by Unai Garro. 
                                  Add manual hot pixel selection. Need to implement pixel selection on
                                  imageregionwidget from digikam core. Can be long
   - Infrared         : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits (similar to FimlGrain. Can be long.
   - Insert Text      : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Lens Distortion  : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Noise Reduction  : TODO. ==> backport new algorithm from Krita (it's better). Can be long.
   - Oil Paint        : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Perspective      : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Separate class to compute Matrix. 
                                  Check why antialiasing filter don't give any effects. Can be long.
   - Rain Drops       : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Can be long.
   - Superimpose      : TODO. ==> complete rewrite of plugin widget (See B.K.O file). Can be long.
   - Texture          : TODO. ==> simple port algorithms to 16 bits. Easy.
   - Unsharp          : TODO. ==> backport new algorithm from ImageMagick (it's better). Can be long.

Nota : For all pending plugins, we need to use new standard dialogs from digikam core instead common dialog from DigikamImagePlugins.

        * pahlibar (2004-10-10): fixed recursive calls in the resizedialog which 
          hung the app

          depending on it's previous state.
        * cgilles (2004-10-09): Update Digikam Splashscreen by Yves Chauffour.
        * pahlibar (2004-10-06): make sure that the messages from the kioslaves are
          i18ned. the translations are in digikam catalogue.
        * jahrens (2004-10-05): Setting album thumbnail through drag and drop.
          Setting the dropped image as the album thumbnail. If the ctrl key
          is pressed, when dropping the image, the thumbnail is set without
          a popup menu. Otherwise it is shown a popup menu.
        * cgilles (2004-10-05): Added new method for to get (X,Y) selection
          coordinates. Request for digikamimageplugins (Raindrop especially). 
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): enable tagalbums to be seen by kipiplugins. tag albums
          have a prefix "Tag:" in their name to differentiate from normal albums
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): added option to not ask for confirmation before moving
          items to trash (off by default).
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): configure.in tests revamped:
          merge multiple configure.ins into one. use pkg-config for libkipi and libkexif
          output clearly at the end as to the status of each of the configure tests
        * jahrens (2004-10-04): The album thumbnails are stored with a relative path in
          the db now. So the album thumbnail will be kept if the album is moved to another
          parent. 
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): put the fear of the lord in the user when deleting camera
          items. make sure that they understand the files are unrecoverable
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): deleting items will either move-to-trash (default) or
          actually delete, depending on user settings.
        * jahrens (2004-10-03): Changed the drag'n'drop behavior when objects are dropped,
          so we have standard drag'n'drop behavior in digikam when the shift or ctrl key is
          pressed. 
          - dropping images on a tag with ctrl key pressed
          The tag is assigned to the images without displaying a popup menu
          which asks if that really should be done (bugzilla #89007)
          - dropping images on an album
          (a) ctrl key pressed: the images are copied to the album
          (b) shift key pressed: the images are moved to the album
          (c) no key pressed: popup menu is shown, whichs asks what to do
          - dropping an album on another album
          (a) ctrl key pressed: the album is copied to the other album
          (b) shift key pressed: the album is moved to the other album
          (c) no key pressed: popup menu is shown, whichs asks what to do
        * pahlibar (2004-10-01): thanks to joern's invaluable contributions to digikam,
          his status has been upgraded from a "mere" developer to author
          also give credit to hans karlsson for the very cool digikam banner and app
          icons
        * pahlibar (2004-10-01): finish implementing the remainder of the camera interface
          features: 
          - context menu for viewing, exif, properties, download, delete
          - new properties dialog
        * jahrens (2004-09-30): 
          - Added an item ("Set as Album Thumbnail") to the context menu in the thumbnail
          view to select a particular image as the album thumbnail - to let the user choose
          his own thumbnails for the albums.
          - Furthermore I've changed the album thumbnail creation completely. The image path,
          from which the album thumbnail was created is now stored in the digikam database.
        
          To create these new album icons, the user has to browse through his albums. The
          first readable image will be used as the default icon. Then he can change the
          album thumbnail to an images he likes (with the context menu as described above).
          This is not the best solution to create the new thumbnails, but we decided not to
          add too much special code to the application which is only needed for the first
          run after an upgrade.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-30): some installations do not specify extern "C" in jpeglib.h
          which leads to linking problems.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-30): new icons for digikam. special thanks to Hans Karlsson
          for this lovely piece of work
        * pahlibar (2004-09-29): auto orientation of image using lossless jpeg operation
          implemented in the cameragui. on by default. customize in the advanced options
        * pahlibar (2004-09-28): use mime specific icons for camera items
        * pahlibar (2004-09-28): removed kioslave camera implementation (has been replaced
          with threaded version) 
        * cgilles (2004-09-27): Added icon for imageplugins help
        * pahlibar (2004-09-24): 
          - simplified camera gui interface
          - kioslave interface was getting too kludgy. replaced with threads
          - advanced options: currently implemented - file rename while downloading
        * jahrens (2004-09-23): added setIcon for PAlbum
        * pahlibar (2004-09-21): sync with libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-09-20): use ktempfile to save the generated thumbnail (fudged
          from kio::previewjob) so that race conditions with other apps is prevented and
          also files are saved with 0600 permissions (closer adherence to fd.o stds)
        * pahlibar (2004-09-19): sloppy programming. forgot to escape the urls/filenames
          for the database query.
        * rytilahti (2004-09-18): save the splitter position
        * pahlibar (2004-09-16): Fixed crash when deleting files (this should fix the
         rename batchprocess plugin crash reported by gilles also). thumbnailjob was
         referencing a kfileitem which got deleted by kdirlister. couldn't find the exact
         place of the problem, so reverted back to using kurls in the thumbnailjob.
         - removed imlib2 loading of thumbnails, as some tests indicated that faster
         loading of thumbnails can be doing a png load directly into a qimage. code for
          that coming soon.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15): sync with libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15): 
          - move the deleting files from database code from the main app to kioslave,
          this makes the deleting file operations appear much lesser non-blocking
          - added code for showing the tag albums in the kipiplugins, but disabled it
          till issues with the imagegallery are resolved.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15): strip off newlines from squeezed text. clears up
          rendering issues in the thumbnail view

          for eg, a context menu is requested on a view.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-08): don't stat if the src url is not a local
          file/directory. just pass it on straight through to kio::copyjob
        * cgilles (2004-09-08): Added PNG max compression when saving PNG images
        * pahlibar (2004-09-07):

         hide menubar & statusbar in fullscreen mode for the imagewindow.
         plug and unplug the fullscreen action in the toolbar accordingly
        * pahlibar (2004-09-06): 
          create the toolbar with proper object name. dunno why ktoolbar took off
          the option to specify the object name in the constructor
        * pahlibar (2004-09-05): 
          following a suggestion from mornfall, its now possible to assign/remove tags
          which have subtags from the context menu, without causing too much confusion
        * pahlibar (2004-09-05): 
          reposition filetip after resize.
        * cgilles (2004-09-05): Fixed an i18n problem between the real ImagePlugins name

          Using now the libraries plugins name for the ImagePlugins setup.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04): 
          finally.... proper indication of which of the left and right view have
          the focus in the mainwindow. the view which has the focus is shown
          raised and the other one is shown sunken
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04): 
          fixed restoring the position and size of mainwindow and imagewindow(previous 
          commit) after fullscreen maximization
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04): 
          fixed broken fullscreen maximization for imageeditor.
        * jahrens (2004-09-04):

        * cgilles (2004-09-03): Fixed include header. Work fine now with
          digikamimageplugins cvs module (alone mode resqueted by Achim Bohnet). 
        * cgilles (2004-09-02): Fixed header for digikamimageplugins building
        * cgilles (2004-09-02): Using KIPI icon
        * jahrens (2004-09-01): 
          - album drag and drop
            - albums can be moved/copied in the album folder view through drag and drop. 
              So albums can be rearranged.
          - albums can be dropped on a collection to assign it to the collection
          - Completely rewrite of AlbumFolderView::contentsDragMoveEvent()
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): don't do the albumfolderitem open/close once the initial
          loading is complete. this prevents surprises during DnD copy/move of albums
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): use digikamio for copying/moving files/albums.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): 
          - app interface for digikamio kioslave: uses digikamio kioslave for
          file/folder copy/move within the album library and KIO::copyjob for
          external file/folder copy/move.
          - busyprogressbar: a progressbar which shows a busy indicator when the
          total and current progress is not (the progress bar shuttles from
          left to right). used within the digikamio app interface. can be used
          elsewhere
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): 
          digikamio:
          - new kioslave for file/folder copying/moving while preserving all metadata.
          - unlike kde file kioslave this can move/copy folders recursively
          - handles four cases of copy/move: a) album copy/move b) file copy/move
           c) external folder copy/move into album library d) external file copy/move
           into album library
        * cgilles (2004-09-01): Fixed slider/spinbox slots
        * jahrens (2004-08-31): Minor drag and drop changes
        * cgilles (2004-08-31): Added link to DigikamImagePlugins handbooks in ImageEditor
          help menu 
        * jahrens (2004-08-30): Drag and drop improvement:
          An album is opened and displays its children when the mouse pointer pauses over
          the album during drag and drop. 
        * jahrens (2004-08-29): Added an import option to import image folders as digikam
          albums 
         - select the parent album in the folder view (if no album is selected root will be the parent)
         - Album->Import->Import Folders...
         -select the folders in the appearing file select dialog
        * rhoezler (2004-08-26): - "Correct EXIF orientation tag" now works on all
          selected images, not just the first one 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-26): 
         - if drag moves over an unacceptable position, remove the old droptarget
          and set it to zero. prevents surprises in case of dropevents.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-26):  as joern pointed out the drag was being called out
          multiple times. i turned on the contents mouse tracking for implementing the
          tooltips which led to this breakage.this commit will set startDragItem to zero
          once mouse leaves the widget 
        * jahrens (2004-08-26): Dragging an object in the albumiconview can continuously
          produce new drag objects.
          1. Select an image in the albumiconview
          2. drop it on the albumfolderview or at the window title, so the drag object 
           is destroyed
          3. don't press the mouse button and leave the mouse over the albumiconview,
           but not over an image. the image is still selected.
          4. switch to another desktop by a shortcut and switch back to the desktop
           that displays digikam
          5. a new QMouseEvent is generated. Since the mouse isn't positioned over an
           image a new drag object for the previously selected image is created -> bug!
        * rhoezler (2004-08-26): - Fix order of transformation during EXIF auto rotate
          Add missing "horizontal flip" option that was lost when moving it to the image menu
        * cgilles (2004-08-26): Add new cursor changing method for the image preview
          widget (using by the long preview process like OilPaint for to show a 
          waiting cursor in the widget area).
        * cgilles (2004-08-25): Setup : fixed kipi plugins icon setup.
          ImagePreviewWidget : Added moved action between Pan icon widget
          and Image region widget when the selection focus have changed (thanks to Joern 
          for this idea). The Image Region is updated but not the preview effect during the
          selection mouvement (only when the mouse is released). This way improveme the
          region selection choise in the original image.
        * cgilles (2004-08-25): Fix pan size for the large original image.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): fix a bunch of memory leaks
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): fix memory leak
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): enable ok button only if values have changed from zero
          state.some cleanup in hsl

          Fixed Makefiles in according.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-23): warn users on an attempt to delete an album or a tag, if
          there are sub albums and tags. also show the number of sub albums and tags.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-23): use WStyle_Splash for splash screen. makes splashscreen
          hideable by clicking on it. added a new page to the setup dialog
          (Miscellaneous). added option to turn off splashscreen
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): write comments only to jpeg jfif section. we want to
          reserve exif user comments for the Adobe XMP metadata (maybe)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): use kmenubar instead of qmenubar for the guibuilder, so
         that kde specific menubar settings (Mac OS type menubar for eg) is respected
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): break lines in tooltip only at word boundaries
        * jahrens (2004-08-22): Tags can be dropped on images to assign the tag
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): show filesize in both human readable form and in bytes 
          change Date -> Modification Date
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): use local aware date string format. break comments when
          too long 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): show corner arrows based on position (fudged from
          kfiletip(libkonq)) 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): don't show tooltips if thumbview is not the active window 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): loose the tooltip on focusout
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): showing tooltips is now configurable. on by default
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): show meta info also in tooltip (at some point we will
          have to make this customizable)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): polishing tooltip - break line between tags, don't break
          line elsewhere, strip leading / from album/tag names (albumfiletip.cpp)
          hide tooltip on mousepressevent on thumbnail view (thumbview.cpp)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): tooltips for thumbnail items
        * pahlibar (2004-08-19): use middle mouse button to scroll image
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): assign/remove tags in bulk using right click menu
        * jahrens (2004-08-18): Added drag and drop for tags.
          - Tags can be moved and dropped on another tag inside the album folderview,
          so it is possible to rearrange the tag hierarchy.
          - When a tag is moved to another parent its children are moved as well.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): seems the last deselecting items when selection box
          changes wasn't completely correct. ctrlbutton-down-and-mousemove should not
          remove existing selection 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): drag selection should unselect items outside the
          selection box. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-16): show an error message if exif correction fails
        * pahlibar (2004-08-15): set block size of gdbm file to 0, so that it will pick up
          the correct blocksize from the filesystem. prevents thrashing of the filesystem
          so much 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-15): do the initial selection of albums/tags only after all
          albums have been loaded. last selected tag can also be remembered now.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-14):  dump and restore album tree state. remember last album
          opened (only physical albums, not tags - as listing files in tags requires that
          the corresponding physical albums have been loaded already and because of kio
          loading of albums, this is not guaranteed)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-12): added theme "Clean"
        * rhoezler (2004-08-12): Move "Set Exif Orientation" RMB entry to Image->Correct
          Exif Orientation Tag. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-12): changed version to 0.7.0-cvs. use kde b.k.o. as default
          reportbug option

          http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/menus/index.html
        * jahrens (2004-08-11): Changed the cameraui context menu to make it look like the
          albumiconview context menu.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-10): use exif rotation only if requested
        * jahrens (2004-08-10): Added a context menu to cameraui.
        * rhoezler (2004-08-10): Save correct orientation tag if image has been EXIF
          auto-rotated and modified/saved. 
        * rhoezler (2004-08-10): Implemented EXIF-based rotation in the image editor via
          the Imlib interface. 
        * jahrens (2004-08-09): Removed populatetags to rebuild the tag layout. Instead
          adding/removing a TAlbumChecklistItem. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-08): in thumbview, controlbutton + drawrubber should preserve
          existing selection 
        * jahrens (2004-08-07): Context menu appears after RMB everywhere in the listctrl
          (imagedescedit) with root selected as tag when no tag was under the mouse. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-07): fix crash when requested texture width/height is <= 0
        * pahlibar (2004-08-06): enable editing of tags from comments/tag editor
        * pahlibar (2004-08-06): Compilation fixes in imagelevels.cpp. added new theme Marine
          improved Dreary Theme
        * cgilles (2004-08-06): Added methods for to load/save levels data values from/to
          a Gimp levels text file. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): add a menuitem to add a camera from the cameras menu
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): moving to the first row of thumbnails using keys will
          ensure that the header is also shown
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): bump up the version of the xmlgui file
        * cgilles (2004-08-05): Added Set/Get levels values methods.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-04): arrow in listview should use text color
        * jahrens (2004-08-04): Added a context menu to comments/tags dialog
          (ImageDescEdit) to add/delete tags. "Edit" is still unavailable, because changes 
          made to tags in this dialog are not forwarded to the albumiconview. So I have
          disabled edit until I found a solution. 
        * pahlibar (2004-08-04): digikam gets theming support. fluxbox style themes
         (texture renderer fudged from fluxbox code). themes can be installed at system
         level $PREFIX/share/apps/digikam/themes or in user home directory in
         ~/.kde/share/apps/digikam/themes. sample theme ("Dreary") included
        * cgilles (2004-08-04): ImageEditor: fixed disable menu actions when an image is
         opened from cameraclient. The actions are 'File/remove from current Album' and
         'Image/Comments' 
        * cgilles (2004-08-03): ImageEditor :
          - Added config tab in main setup dialog.
          - New option: JPEG quality image during saving operations.
          - New option: background color setting.
          - Fixed TIFF saving operations.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-02): renaming of albums while retaining meta data
        * cgilles (2004-08-02): Histogram viewer: added drawing all color channels (RGB)
          at the same time capability.

        * cgilles (2004-08-02): fixed histogram viewer crash if current image loaded failed
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Fixed histogram rendering in according with Achim bohnet
          advices. 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-30): Fix crash when slave dies
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Added wait cursor during image traitments. The calculation
          can be long if the image size is big. 
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Using ImageHistogram API in normalize and Equalize algorithms.
        * cgilles (2004-07-29): First import of autolevel correction class (adapted from
          the Gimp2.0). Added menu entry in ImageDitor for AutoLevel correction.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-28): added iterator for albums
        * jahrens (2004-07-28): Changed drag'n'drop popup menues to make them look like
          other kde applications 
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added new common ColorGrdientWidget for HistogramViewer in
          ImageEditor and File properties dialog. Source code more simply...
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added new image Histogram tab in File properties dialog.
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added image Histogram Viewer.
          - New Histogram manipulation class.
          - New Histogram widget.
          - New Histogram Viewer dialog for ImageEditor.
        * jahrens (2004-07-27): Added drag'n'drop from external sources to AlbumFolderView 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-27): Reorganization of cvs.
          - digikam/libs digikam/libs/guibuilder digikam/libs/histogram added
          - guibuilder code moved to digikam/libs/guibuilder
        * pahlibar (2004-07-26): added texture building routines (fudged from
          fluxbox). this will form the basis of theming support for digikam (around
          v0.8). use the texture routines to build base pixmaps for thumbnail
          items. currently hard-coded colors. 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-26): when the native thumbnail loader fails and kde previewjob
          is used, the previewjob returns the thumbnail with fileitem. if the file got
          deleted in the meantime or the album got changed, digikam will crash as the
          kfileitem has been deleted and we are referencing a deleted item. solution: use
          kurl causing previewjob to generate its own kfileitem and on return use the url to
          find the item in the dictionary to assign the pixmap.
        * jahrens (2004-07-25): Adding a tab to KPropertiesDialog to show the extra
          information retrieved from the camera 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): double-click/return-press will open up the imageviewer
          for the camera file items
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): Disable saving of images when viewing a camera file in
          the image editor. User can still use saveas to save the file elsewhere. at some
          point, we have to start thinking of allowing user to save the file and the file
          gets uploaded back into the camera. maybe too much of a hassle for an
          infrequently used operation
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): implemented viewing image
        * pahlibar (2004-07-24): - added: retrieve and show camera information
          (summary/manual/about). fix: the error dialog in camera window is now correctly
          placed over the camera window.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-24): slowly adding back all the old features from the
          digikamcameraclient 
          - implemented getting exif information for a camera file item
          - pahlibar (2004-07-24): 
          - if thumbnail can't be loaded from database, delete the key
          - safety checks: check if db is valid
        * pahlibar (2004-07-23): "instant loading" thumbnails
          - creates a database file (gdbm database) in ~/.thumbnails
          - adds a tiny low resolution (48x48) thumbnail for each file in the album
          that you browse to using digikam
          - on loading an album, this database is queried to see if a thumbnail is
          present for a file and if yes, this thumbnail is loaded, rough scaled to
          the size needed and shown.
          - the regular thumbnail loader runs in the background, as usual, and it
          keeps updating the displayed thumbnails, essentially smoothing the
          thumbnails.
         - result is that if the user visits an album which he/she has browsed to
          before, the rough thumbnail are shown fast and then the smoothing process
          of the thumbnails begin.
         - regular thumbnails are still stored according to the freedesktop standards
        * pahlibar (2004-07-23): 
          - set the cursor to a busy cursor when loading images.
          - semi-progressive painting of the images when flipping between
          images. essentially what it does is splits the painting of the image into
          multiple small paints (stripwise). used only when loading an image and not
          while scrolling/zooming/... . scrolling through images should be
          non-blocking and seem a bit faster
         - preload next image (not really sure it helps since rendering is the
         - most expensive part and we do not do any rendering in the preload)
         - fixed a painting bug when resizing the selection with handles
        * pahlibar (2004-07-22): fixed memory leak which caused imlib to not free memory
          on closing the imagewindow
        * pahlibar (2004-07-21): Camera File Properties dialog a la KDE file properties dialog.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-21): implemented select all/none/invert for camera window
        * cgilles (2004-07-21): ImageEditor: Added new image colors enhacement plugin
          'Normalize'. 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-20): two levels of redeye correction:
          a) mild - use if other parts of face have been selected
          b) aggressive - use if eye(s) have been selected exactly
        * pahlibar (2004-07-20): optimization for loading items in a tag (especially
          recursively). seems queries on sqlite when using JOIN tables is rather slow. by building
          the album list manually and then querying items from the tag table alone,
          the queries are much faster (nearly 10x speed increase). consequently
          listing of items from the tags  has a >2x speed increase (stating and
          listentry slow things down).
        * cgilles (2004-07-20): Fix RGB image plugin sliders (look similar with Photoshop
          and The Gimp) 
        * cgilles (2004-07-20): Fix balance values for BCG image plugin (like photoshop
          and the Gimp). 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-19): 
          - initial version cameragui
          - merged back into main application
          - interface for interacting with digikamcamera kioslave in a
          - connection oriented mode
          - only download implemented currently
          - dirselectdialog (modified from kdirselectdialog) for
          - selecting/creating target album
        * pahlibar (2004-07-18): 
          - initial version of camera kioslave
          - unlike kamera this is a connection oriented kioslave.
          - only download implemented currently. rest to follow. initial gui tomorrow.
        * rytilahti (2004-07-17): Check if the camera hasn't been added to the list after
          the last save. Also fixed some messages to 
          KDE standard ones.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): improved the sepia filtering, using the hsl functions.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): included some utility functions to convert from RGB to
          HSL and back. Useful for plugins.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): fix crash in slotSaveAs. only try to write exif if both
          src and destination are jpeg files. also emit a signal to indicate that a file
          has been modified when saving.
        * cgilles (2004-07-16): ImageEditor: added new HSL balance correction plugin !
        * cgilles (2004-07-16): ImageEditor : Added new 'Free image rotation' option with
          dialog. 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-13): keyevents behave more like standard listviews.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-13): emit a signal when a file has been added. tag albums
          don't update automatically. copy all the metadata when using saveas not just the
          comments. removed unnecessary double loading of image
        * cgilles (2004-07-13): - Re-enable 'File print' option from the old ImageViewer.
          This implementation is impired of Kuickshow source code and freeze the GUI during the
          printing calculation. I will push that in a thread...
          - Added Save and Saveas method in imlibiface.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): Sort Images by Name, Path, Date, File Size
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): on initial display, the initial sizes of the left and
          right view are to be in the ratio of 1:2. sometimes these sizes were not set
          right. override the resizeevent to set the ratios correctly on initial loading
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): fix importing of images. allow importing only if
          destination album is a physical album
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Added Image comments edit dialog for ImageEditor.
          Restored the Image Comments Edit option from old ImageViewer.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Restored View Exif info from old ImageViewer.
          Added new menu entry 'Image'.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Restored Image file properties menu option from old ImagViewer.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Added proview effect to sharpen and blur pimageplugins.
          Removed selection parsing.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): BCG ImagePlugin : Added whatsthis, help button, and Reset
          values button. 
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Added new ImageEditor plugin : colors balance (RGB adjustments) !!!
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): shift-arrow keyboard keys will allow multiple selection of items. 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): Make recursive retrieval a setup option
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): 
          - reimplement the item lister using pure kdirlister and use the new
            digikamtags protocol
          - non-blocking listing of items in Tag Albums from database.
          - Currently recursive retrieval is hard coded in by default.
            need to make this selectable in the setup dialog
          - use updatedirectory instead of reloading the items from tag in case
            of modifications. (more work might be needed here. maybe a kdirwatch
            to watch the items in the tag, as kdirlister doesn't do it for us
            thinking its a non-local protocol)
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): 
          -  kioslave to retrieve items in a tag album in a non-blocking fashion
            implemented as a virtual filesystem with tag albums retrieved as
            virtual folders. but the files themselves are listed as local files
            with protocol "file"
          - recursive retrieval of items in subtags (only if requested)
          - an important side-effect of the kioslave is that users can see the
            tag albums in konqueror. just type digikamtags:/ in the locationbar.
            by default recursive retrieval is disabled for external applications.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-09): 
          In the comments/tag-editor Ctrl-Enter will save and move onto
          the next item. Shift-Enter will save and move to the prev item
        * cgilles (2004-07-09): Added new image plugins for ImageEditor : blur and sharpen
          filters ! 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-08): Use stdgui items for forward back buttons in
          tag-comments-editor 
        * pahlibar (2004-07-08): Added a checkbox in the comment/tag-editor to
          automatically save comments/tags when navigating between items
        * pahlibar (2004-07-07): 
          Large number of changes:
          a) interfaces subdirectory removed. some of the code moved to digikam subdir
          b) sqlite source code (v2.8.14) imported into a separate subdir
          c) AlbumManager/AlbumDB/Album (note: change in name from AlbumInfo->Album)
             rewritten from scratch
          d) AlbumDB is the new sqlite based database backend instead of the old xml
             style database. Old xml database will be imported automatically into
             the new database. No export function yet (do we still need a separate
             digikam xml format? we can think of exporting to some other app format,
             like kimdaba/kphotobook). Note: the old xml files are still retained,
             so you can safely run this new digikam on your existing album library.
          e) Album is an abstract class with derived implementations of two (currently)
             kinds: Physical Albums (PAlbum) - representing folders on the drive and
             Tag Album (TAlbum) - representing tags in the database
          f) Nested albums supported (some optimization might be needed for loading
             the initial list of physical albums). both folders and tags can have
             unlimited nesting
          g) Native light-weight implementation of a treeview to replace qlistview
             based treeview. this new implementation is flicker-free and has a cleaner
             look compared to qlistview
          h) Tagging of images added (you must have guessed it from the above statements).
             Tags are shown as "albums" under a subtree of the treeview on the left.
             Tagging can be done individually for an image using a dialog (enhanced version
             of  the old comments dialog) or in bulk by selecting a bunch of images and
             dragging and dropping on a tag.
          i) rewrite of the painting routines by getting information from the database
             diretly instead of loading it into memory. thumbnail items have a fixed
             grid size and text not fitting into the grid will be shown truncated with dots.
             (need to add a tooltip for this)
          f) extra information that can be shown in the thumbnail view:
             name (yes, name is hideable), date, file size, resolution, comments,
             jpeg comments, tags. removed items: Exif comments and mimetype
          g) lots more. i will add them to the ChangeLog as and when i remember them
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Fixed TipOfDay slot
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Extract the DigikamPlugins TipOfDays for LibKipi.
          Add a merging call of Digikam and Kipi TipsOfDays at the same time.
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Update
        * cgilles (2004-06-19): Fix release number 0.6.3 -> 0.7.0
          Added ReadSettings method to kipiinterface.
        * cgilles (2004-06-18): [no log message]
        * cgilles (2004-06-16): Fix KIPI plugins category indentification in according
          with last libKIPI changes. 
        * cgilles (2004-06-15): Changed plugins category identification in according with
          the last LibKIPI changes. 
        * cgilles (2004-06-15): Updated the menu and popup menu in according with KIPI
          plugins actions. Added 'album_action' collection. 
        * pahlibar (2004-06-14): make sure image resize dialog has the imagewindow as
          parent, so that it doesn't cause the imagewindow to bury itself when invoked
        * cgilles (2004-06-14): The Batch Processes KIPI plugins can be used now directly
          by the AlbumFolder popup menu. 
        * cgilles (2004-06-14): Fixed KIPI plugins dynamic loading/unloading
        * pahlibar (2004-06-13): 
          Shift-Wheel to move between images. Ctrl-Wheel to change zoom
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): 
          1) zoom in small steps 10% increments
          2) hold shift button and roll the wheel mouse to zoomin/out
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): 
          fixed minor painting issue with the selection rectangle
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): 
         alpha blended selection for smooth selections unlike the last
         cross-hatched pattern from qpainter. 
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): 
          1) Bump up the delay for smooth painting a bit in imageeditor
          2) add album title as caption for the imageeditor
          3) add first and last buttons to the toolbar in the imageeditor
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): imageeditor selection gets resize handles.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-11): 
          1) Zooming should be much faster (and use considerably less memory at
          large zooms). rendering done in two phases: a sub-super-pixel sampled
          scaled one first and with a qtimer timeout an antialiased scaled one.
          we take advantage of imlib2 speed (and cache use) and render from image
          to pixmap for every repaint. only exposed area is rendered unlike
          previously where the entire image was rendered to a cached pixmap.
          
          2) fix 2 of the bugs reported by  Mikolaj Machowski:
            a) space between resolution and "pixels"
            b) imageviewer being pushed back behind main app when a plugin
               dialog opens
        * rhoezler (2004-06-11): Implement Libkexif changes (writing EXIF data without
          reading it). 
        * rhoezler (2004-06-08): Make it compile after Libkexif change.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-08): minor performance optimizations. don't render to mask
          unless image has alpha 
        * pahlibar (2004-06-08): 
          Cleaned up the imageplugin interface. hopefully should be easier to program for.
          enable selection based image plugin actions (eg. redeye) only if a selection
          is made
        * pahlibar (2004-06-07): 
          first set of digikam imageeditor plugins:
          1) adjust brightness/contrast/gamma
          2) convert to black & white
          3) convert to sepia (too strong a sepia cast now. need to fix this)
          4) solarizing plugin
          5) redeye correction plugin.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-07): 
          new imageeditor merge. old imageviewer still retained (not compiled though,
          till all the functions are ported).
          New features:
          1) ported to imlib2
          2) new gui - based on qmainwindow with menubar and toolbar
          3) plugin interface so that image editor plugins can be written externally
          4) native dynamic gui builder instead of xmlgui for performance reasons.
          5) new selection method
          6) new resize image option
        * rhoezler (2004-06-07): - Check for and use Libkexif from kdeextra-libs-1 now for
          Digikam. Building digikam/utilities/kexif is disabled, but I won't remove the
          files until we're sure it doesn't cause any problems.
        * cgilles (2004-06-07): Enable kipi plugins support on configure script by default.
        * rhoezler (2004-06-07): - Load KIPI plugins via loadPlugins() again
          - Pass entire path to plugin, not just image name
        * rhoezler (2004-06-06): - Prevent digikam from crashing, if it could not get a plugin.
        * rhoezler (2004-06-06): - Make digikam compile with the lateset libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-06-02): 
          prevent thumbnail kioslave from crashing, if the imlib2 imageloader is
          not able to return image data
        * pahlibar (2004-06-02): 
          more subdued highlighting for thumbnails.
          load the metainfo only if its requested (showing the initial screen with
          filenames and empty thumbnails should be much faster now if file comments
          and/or resolution is not requested). fix memory leak if file metainfo is
          requested multiple times.
          in setup warn users that above two makes things slower.

v0.6.0-RC        11/27/03
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * Added plugins submenu 'Transform' in 'images' main menu.
        * Added Czech and Hungarian i18n.
        * Removed jpeglossless code from main application. Moved to a plugin
        * Added kioslave based thumbnail generation code. there were
          problems with the threaded version and some qt/kde versions.
        * Drag and drop copy/move of images between albums will also copy/move
          comments. these use wrappers around kde kio classes to move/copy 
          comments along with the files
        * Plugins can merge their actions into the right-click menu of the
          thumbnailview by just adding "X-Digikam-MergeMenu=true" in their
          desktop file
        * Removed a source of flicker in the albumiconview
        * Thumbnail Generator added to interfaces. more robust (with
          jpeg error checking - thanks to Marcus Meissner) and simpler to
          use (using signals/slots). Provides a non-blocking thumbnail
          generation interface compliant with freedesktop.org
          standards (which is used by the main application and also can be
          used by any of the plugins).
        * Now instead of download to directory in the cameraclient, we
          have download to album. also new albums can be created directly
          from the cameraclient.
        * Fixed selection problem in albumfolderview in case of DnD.
        * Fixed a bug in Album::getPath() API plugins implementation.
        * Plugins can refresh the view if they change the comments of the items.
        * Now, the album library is the only place where you add or delete albums.
        * All the information for an album (collection,date,comments) and for the
          items in the album (currently only comments) are stored in a single xml
          file ( called digikam.xml ) inside the album itself.
        * Now albums are directly detected in the album library path, no need
          for manual addition and deletion.
        * The comments.xml file has been changed to digikam.xml and its format
          also has changed.
        * Added a doxyfile to generate documentation for the plugin API.
        * Now we have a new clean API and its well documented.

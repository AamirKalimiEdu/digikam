	  digikam from trunk: new Slideshow Tool using Preview feature !
	  
	  Hi guys, you can slide your RAW files very fast like this !!!
	  
	  This slide show tool is a simplified version of kipi-plugins
	  SlideShow tool. No effect, no OpenGL. Just the picture slided on
	  the screen.
	  
	  But the must important feature is to use Image Preview : RAW
	  files can be slided and pictures saved by digiKam image editor
	  will be loaded very fast because we use preview image embeded in
	  IPTC metadata (that the kipi-plugins cannot do it).
	  
	  This slide show tool run always in fullscreen mode. this have
	  simplified the common EditorWindow class implementation.
	  
	  This slide show tool is available in Image Editor and Showfoto
	  instead the old one. Added it to Album Gui is not a problem. It's
	  very easy to add the right action on the main window menu.
	  
	  Luka, If you want to do it before 0.9.1-Beta1, let's go to, and
	  close files #135655, #140303, #140304. thanks in advance...

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/kioslave/digikamthumbnail.cpp,
	  trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp:
	  Disable the use of the DImg raw loader when loading as DImg from
	  digikamthumbnail ioslave.
	  
	  We are using KProcess for the raw loader and make two
	  assumptions:
	  - there is an event loop (not for ioslaves)
	  - the loader is not called from the event loop thread (currently
	  no use case in digikam)
	  
	  The DImg raw loader is not needed - DcrawIface is called before.
	  So the problem of the loader entering an endless loop (because no
	  events from KProcess
	  are delivered) arises only if a file is identified as RAW, but
	  dcraw does not
	  support it.

	  - digiKam/Showfoto Setup : separate dcraw decoding settings from
	  IO File Settings page. A new page dedicaced to dcraw settings
	  have been added.
	  The "IO File Settings" page have been renamed to "Save Images".
	  Settings from this page will be moved to a other place later
	  0.9.1, especially to repective saving image dialog like
	  Gimp/Photoshop.
	  - add new dcraw icon

	  When implementing MetadataHub for Drag&Drop tag assignment etc.,
	  it became obvious
	  that such a mode is needed: If a user has turned off writing tags
	  to IPTC
	  keywords, he will not expect that the other metadata fields are
	  written to the file
	  if he only assigns new tags.
	  It is easily possible to implement that in the calling code one
	  level higher but
	  that's not the idea with MetadataHub ;-)

	  pictures, or leave
	  it untouched.
	  
	  Additionally, there is a button "More" which allows a batch
	  operation for the
	  currently selected pictures, either Metadata->database or
	  database->metadata
	  (the latter only for multiple selection, for single selection
	  this is equivalent
	  to pressing the apply button).
	  
	  Problems and pending tasks:
	  - test it
	  - the Image Properties tab currently still displays only the
	  first picture. It needs to
	  support a multiple-selection mode with at least the file system
	  properties.
	  - the "More" button may clutter the UI, better implementations
	  welcome
	  - in the navigate bar all four buttons are disabled. Perhaps hide
	  them, but without
	  making the whole layout jump (I didn't know how to do that)
	  - it would be nice if the number in "Editing 25 pictures" could
	  be bold, but KSqueezedText
	  does not allow rich text
	  - if a tag is added from IPTC metadata and newly created in DB,
	  it is unchecked initially in ImageDescEditTab. Need to debug.
	  - metadata update notification currently always reloads if no
	  changes are made, and does nothing
	  if modified. For multiple selection more refined solutions are
	  too complex. Perhaps it's ok like this.

	  way been wrong because it hardcoded directly on image algorithm
	  the indicator witch have a side effect on preview histogram!
	  - Now, the widget witch render on the screen the preview image
	  will render the over and under exposure indicator : advantages :
	  * preview is render more fast because the corrected image is not
	  recomputed.
	  * target image histogram is not affected by the over-colored area
	  depending of unde/over exposed pixels !
	  - Add 2 new buttons on the top right corner of preview area to
	  toggle on/off the indicators.
	  - Like the preview widget is common of all image plugins, all
	  will support automaticly this new feature. Thanks to C++ (:=)))

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/digikam/Makefile.am: digiKam
	  from trunk : fix broken compilation with --enable-final and
	  metadatahub.cpp
	  
	  Marcel: we have a problem with multiple inclusion of X11 headers
	  in digiKam source code.
	  Theses one redefine 'enum' type (or something like that) and
	  broke compilation with final compilation option.
	  
	  If you check why X11 header is used in digiKam core (excepted
	  with theme implementation) you can see one
	  X11 method is called to check if CTRL or ALT keys are pressed,
	  especially with D&D stuff. I think we
	  can use Qt API instead everywhere. What do you think about ?

	  be "disjoint",
	  the status will be "available" if all contained the same data.

	  digiKam from trunk : native support of JPEG2000 file format.
	  
	  JPEG2000 is an advanced picture compression file format based on
	  wavelet theory. It support 16 bits/color/pixel, metadata, and ICC
	  color profile. Look url below for more informations:
	  
	  http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000
	  http://www.geocities.com/ee00224/btp2.html
	  http://www.photozone.de/7Digital/jpeg2000.htm
	  
	  Still TODO with this JPEG2000 loader :
	  
	  - The JPEG2000 quality level settings is the same than JPEG in
	  setup dialog. We need to create a dedicaced widget settings for
	  each digiKam image loader (TIFF/PNG/JPEG/JPEG2000). There is a
	  file in B.K.O about this subject.
	  - YCbCr color space is not yet supported. In fact, because
	  digiKam support only RGB* color space, we need to have an ICC
	  color method to transform non-RGB* color space to RGB* using lcms
	  libary for all image file formats witch can do use it
	  (JPEG/JPEG2000/TIFF).
	  - Embedding ICC color profile doesn't work. It implemented but
	  something still wrong.
	  - JPEG2000 Metadata extraction (EXIF/IPTC) not yet done in Exiv2.
	  
	  To packagers : digiKam have a new library depency : libJasper.

	  digikam from trunk: fix in color management :
	  
	  - To be abble to use CM is no input color profile is set in CM
	  setup. In this case, we use built-in sRGB color profile from
	  lcms. This will be enough for 0.9.0. Paco, perhaps we must
	  provide an option into CM setup to choose the right mode between
	  "built-in" or "from input icc file". Krita run like this.
	  
	  - By default, using the CM plugin with RAW file instead Color
	  correction dialog.
	  Paco, in fact, I think it's a a non-sence to use ColorCorrection
	  with RAW file. A common option in CM setup is certainly better
	  than 2 separate options : if user choose "Ask when open an image
	  in Image editor" option, well digikam will start CM plugin if the
	  image is a RAW file, or if its JPEG/TIFF/PNG it will start Color
	  correction dialog.
	  
	  - Fix Color Managed View (for Monitor) color management. In fact
	  this mode do not work properlly before this commit, because the
	  input profile is the camera profile. This is wrong with managed
	  view : the input profile must be the workspace profile. This is
	  why some users have reported a wrong color rendering if this
	  option is enable.
	  
	  Paco, please let's me here your comments if necessary. Please
	  update your TODO accordinly for future actions later 0.9.0 final
	  release.

	  Using 75 ms.
	  - set a wait cursor when filtering large numbers of images with
	  tag filter
	  (here it is 500 ms for 1000 images)
	  No cursor for small numbers of images.
	  - emit a signalSelectionChanged from IconView when the last image
	  has been
	  removed (and no image is selected any more)
	  - disconnect signalItemDeleted(AlbumIconItem*) from DigikamView's
	  signal_noCurrentItem

	  - <Shift+Del> brings up the permanently-delete dialog without an

	  - there are hidden actions for delete without confirmation to
	  which power users can assign shortcuts
	  - the current setup option whether to trash or permanently delete
	  is removed from the setup
	  - it is kept internally and used for album deletion, see below
	  - add a new setup option which is identical to the "Do not ask
	  again" option is the trash
	  dialog, so that this setting is reversible
	  - added to AlbumSettings as well
	  - in the AlbumFolderView, if deleting a whole album,
	  only the context menu can be used to select a delete operation -
	  Shift+Del is reserved for images.
	  Here, the user can choose in the dialog whether to trash or
	  delete permanently. This setting is stored.
	  No "Do not ask again" will be available.
	  - all subalbums will be included in the list in the DeleteDialog
	  to make the user aware that
	  he deletes them as well
	  - fix a bug in ImageWindow slotDeleteCurrent with directories
	  that contain a "#"
	  - The DeleteDialog has now five modes of operation, see above.
	  The checkboxes
	  are in a widget stack, all the functionality that was there is
	  still there for future needs.

	  digiKam now store in the camera XML config file the "last camera
	  used date". Each camera are tagged with a date value between
	  camera gui sessions if some pictures have been donwloaded to
	  computer. If no pictures are donloaded with camera gui, the date
	  is unchanged.
	  
	  In fact, all picture dates in the camera witch are most recent
	  than the "last camera used date" will be displayed with a little
	  yellow start to indentify the most recent pictures taken with the
	  camera.
	  
	  To use properlly this little feature, you need to set the right
	  date in your camera !
	  
	  Of course, this way cannot be used to identify the pictures
	  "already downloaded" from camera to computer. For that, we need
	  to have a full camera activity log somewhere (perhaps using the
	  digiKam database).
	  
	  I'm waiting your comments about to implement camera log feature
	  in digiKam.

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/digikam/iconview.cpp: digikam
	  from trunk : general improvements of icon view reactivity !
	  
	  This commit is simple : during items selection using mouse
	  draging, it dispatch the current icons selection event only when
	  user have release the left mouse.
	  
	  Before this commit the implementation sent an event when a new
	  item have been selected during the selection (under the mouse
	  draging with the left button pressed). I other word, the gui will
	  recieve a lot of events to refresh the sidebar. This way
	  decreased the gui reactivity when metadata/properties sidebar is
	  enable. This problem exist also with the Camera Gui. The problem
	  is more important in this case because the data exanged between
	  the computer and the camera will be important to extract metadata
	  for each camera items.
	  
	  IMPORTANT : I have tested digiKam Album Gui and Camera Gui with
	  this fix. All work fine but i would to have a right feedback from
	  the team before to valid this change for the next 0.9.0-beta2
	  planed to september.
	  
	  Thanks in advance for your reports.

	  digikam from trunk : improvement of camera interface : Restoring
	  an old feature from digiKam 0.6.2 to upload pictures to camera.
	  
	  In fact the interface to upload into gphoto2 camera have been
	  never removed but the interface with the new digiKam folder view
	  have never written by renchi.
	  
	  All camera type are supported : Gphoto2, PTP, UMS, etc. This
	  implementation have been tested with my Olympus C3000Z and my
	  Minolta Dynax 5D.
	  
	  By this commit, there is 2 ways to upload pictures in your camera
	  :
	  
	  - Drag & drop between digiKam main interface (or quesror if you
	  want), and camera interface.
	  - Copy and Paste like between digiKam album.
	  
	  Todo : add a new 'Upload' button on the bottom of Camera
	  Interface. I need a feedback from user before to do it... This
	  one is really mandatory ?
	  
	  Note : with Gphoto2 camera, check if the camera dirver support
	  upload using the new camera info dialog available by Camera
	  Interface Help menu.

	  Marcel, this bug is very important to fix before beta1 :
	  
	  http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130525
	  
	  I'm very confuse about the comments into B.K.O. Why we have this
	  problem now ? I have tested indeep the JPEGLoader::save() method
	  in the past...
	  
	  After to have suspected a problem in DMetadata/Exiv2, i suspect
	  now a problem with the libjpeg implementation. Perhaps the record
	  of the icc profile isn't at the right place for example (i have
	  already this problem with libtiff in the past).
	  
	  Your viewpoint will be very appreciate (:=)))

	  pixels), and i convert it to a new 16 bits PNG file using editor.
	  The size of the target PNG file is around 27Mb. If i take the

	  Note : IPTC preview tag embed a 800x600 JPEG image... This tag is

	  - all lcms call are wrapped this new widget. It's more easy to
	  control lcms errors.
	  - this new widget is based on the common metadatawidget from
	  libs/widgets/metadata (used to display Exif/Makernote/iptc/gps).
	  It's more easy to maintain and more powerfull (you can now copy
	  and paste ICC info in clipboard or send it to printer). in fact,
	  this new widget use the same look and feel than metadata view.
	  The Gui is homogenous.
	  - this new widget show new icc tags. This can be improved again
	  (need to lear lcms indeep).
	  - This new widget is used in the Color side bar tab and in the
	  ICC color profile info dialog. The code is common and reduce
	  duplicate implementations.
	  
	  TODO :
	  - add icc tags descriptions.
	  - fix iccpreviewwidget to use the new code.
	  - cietongue widget must show the current loading information in
	  color sidebar (like histogramwidget does) instead the simple
	  label on the bottom. It's more clean...

	  - do not crash when the first item was deleted from camera and

	  - do not request exif for items which will be deleted
	  - IconView: allow to delay updating frequency a bit
	  - use a ched itemRect for CameraIconView. Its faster, but more
	  importantly,

	  Minolta is the only maker (i think) to set un-properlly the Exif

	  information is used to rotate properlly album item thumbs !
	  
	  This commit fix this problem with Dynax 7D and 5D cameras. Other
	  minolta Camera settings need to be decrypted (under Exiv2
	  implementation) to improve this way. Since i'm also an Exiv2
	  developer, i can fix easily the implementation, but i need a

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/libs/imageproperties/imagedescedittab.cpp:
	  digikam from trunk : improving image properties restoration in
	  database using image metadata:
	  
	  - Fix DMetadata method to get image Exif/Iptc tags properlly.
	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc, Rating
	  from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity test -
	  stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these informations are backported to database :
	  
	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or Iptc
	  Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date & time
	  tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in your
	  Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example, digiKam
	  items rating will be appear in main interface.
	  
	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :
	  
	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is no
	  hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We store
	  only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :
	  
	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database and
	  taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.
	  
	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.
	  Please give me your viewpoints into B.K.O. Thanks in advance

	  and work fine. Perhaps i have forget a condition in my tests.

	  The ImageEditor can now access the database independently
	  from main view, i.e. also if main moved to a different directory.
	  
	  - adjust ImageInfo to be more like a database item wrapper class
	  - add a method to ImageWindow to start it with a list of
	  ImageInfo objects, use this in AlbumIconView
	  - adapt ImageWindow to (optional) ImageInfo list
	  - adjust behavior of saveAsIsComplete
	  - add itemChanged methods to ImagePropertiesSidebarDB:
	  - one takes only a URL (no database)
	  - one takes an ImageInfo object (used by ImageWindow, full DB
	  support)
	  - one takes AlbumIconItem and -View (used by main view,
	  full DB support, optional future interaction with the view)
	  - ImageDescEditTab now works on an ImageInfo object
	  - add a copyItem method to ImageInfo as a wrapper for said
	  function from AlbumDB
	  - modify AlbumDB::copyItem to return image id of inserted image
	  - add DISTINCT keyword to second SELECT statement of
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.
	  With all of above changes, I constantly produced bug #113915.
	  I do not know why the SELECT statement produces (in my case)
	  three times
	  the same result so that INSERT complains, and I do not know which
	  of
	  my changes should ever trigger this problem, but the DISTINCT
	  fixes this.
	  If anyone speaks SQL, you might want to check my comment in
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.
	  
	  Currently, the rating is not copied when database information is
	  copied (in copyItem).
	  Should this be done?

	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc, Rating
	  from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity test -
	  stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these informations are backported to database :
	  
	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or Iptc
	  Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date & time
	  tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in your
	  Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example, digiKam
	  items rating will be appear in main interface.
	  
	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :
	  
	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is no
	  hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We store
	  only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :
	  
	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database and
	  taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.
	  
	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.
	  Please give me your viewpoints into B.K.O. Thanks in advance

	  digikam from trunk : Metadata support using Exiv2 :
	  
	  - New image properties sidebar tab named "Metadata" instead old
	  "Exif". This area include :
	  
	  * Standard Exif tags viewer.
	  * MarkerNote Exif tags viewer.
	  * IPTC records viewer.
	  
	  - New capability to copy metadata in clipboard like text.
	  - New capability to print metadata.
	  - Tags name use the "user Friendly" conversion from Exiv2 instead
	  the internal name provided by old Exif viewer based on libkexif.
	  - Capability to read metadata from CRW files (Canon RAW files)
	  - New class DMetadata to load/save metadata without loading image
	  data. Actually JPEG, CRW, and PNG files are supported. About PNG
	  (Exif and IPTC raw profiles generated by ImageMagick are
	  supported.
	  
	  To support new file formats (like NEF, MRW, TIFF, DNG, etc), new
	  image file parsers must be added to Exiv2 library.
	  
	  IMPORTANT:
	  
	  - Exiv2 do not support yet gettext for i18n rules. All
	  informations in metadata viewers aren't yet i18n (tags name, tags
	  values, and tags descriptions)
	  - Any tag names use internal Exiv2 name, not the user friendly
	  text transformations. This point must be fixed in Exiv2 libs.
	  
	  To 0.9.0, these tools are just metadata readers. Writting
	  capabilities (metadata editors) will added later 0.9.0. The files
	  in B.K.O directly or indirectly relevant of this commits are
	  listed below :

	  - split signalChanged from a signal indicating a change in
	  undo/redo status
	  (now signalUndoRedoStateChange)
	  - slots in ImageWindow and Showfoto are split accordingly
	  - isReadOnly can be retrieved from Canvas/DImgInterface,
	  no need to pass it all the way through signals.
	  Added appropriate methods
	  - add extra check to avoid reentrancy in saving. Just for safety.
	  - what was setModified(false) is now clearUndoManager,
	  setModified(true)
	  is now setModified and used extensively inside DImgInterface
	  - in slotSavingFinished, reorder enabling actions a bit so that
	  the loading call can start
	  from a cleanly defined state
	  - saving is not a modification; do not emit signalModified.
	  - do not reload image after saving. Added code to saveIsComplete
	  to do what is done
	  in the loading slots except for actually loading
	  - setViewToURL
	  - not reloading implies that undo history is kept over saving.
	  - Formerly, the image did not need to be saved when undo history
	  was empty.
	  Now, a point of origin needs to be introduced to the undo manager
	  which identifies the state
	  that is identical to the file on disk.
	  - signalUndoRedoStateChange gets a third bool parameter.
	  - do not clear undo manager in DImgInterface when saving
	  - call LoadingCacheInterface::putImage to put the image into
	  cache in ImageWindow and showfoto
	  - In Canvas and DImgInterface, both save and saveAs were unused
	  and untested. Marked as deprecated,
	  renamed saveAsTmpFile to saveAs.
	  - ported DImgInterface to new putImage and bitBltImage methods of
	  DImg

	  - group data members of a DImg object:
	  - metadata
	  - image data (null, width, height, alpha, sixteenbit)
	  - data pointer
	  With imaging operations, the first group is always preserved, the
	  latter two may change
	  - add a few private methods for often reused code
	  - add a private constructor which copies metadata, but creates a
	  new data buffer with a new size,
	  used by copy and scale
	  - add a putImage method which replaces the data pointer and the
	  image data,
	  used by DImgInterface and thus the image plugins
	  - add a stripImageData method which allows to "strip" the data
	  off, take
	  ownership of the buffer, and leave the image as null. Useful for
	  temporary images.
	  - extend bitBlt to support source coordinates, width and height
	  parameters.
	  - add some flavors of the bitBltImage method, all using bitBlt in
	  the end
	  - use bitBlt for copy and crop to eliminate all the code doing
	  simple blitting operations
	  - add some comments in dimg files
	  - add a method metadata(DImg::METADATA) in analogy to attribute()
	  and embeddedText().
	  Is a method setMetadata necessary?

	  text tags. This technic come from ImageMagick tool and still
	  fully compatible with it and Perl::EXIFTool. Nothing is broken in
	  PNG to respect PNG compatibility with others sothwares/OS.
	  Existing PNG Raw profiles are listed at this url :

	  - Now digiKam can display Exif informations embedded in PNG files
	  when a JPEG files have been converted to PNG using standard
	  'convert' ImageMagick tool or batch convert image kipi plugin
	  (this one using ImageMagick) ! Select a PNG file from your
	  photographs collection, enable Exif sidebar, and ENJOY...
	  
	  - With Image Editor, the metadata are preserved in these
	  workflows : JPEG -> PNG and PNG -> JPEG.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Add a conversion on the fly with digiKam camera GUI. Actually,
	  it's very easy to do JPEG/RAW -> PNG conversion with metadata
	  backup.
	  RAW Exif metadata can be get using THM files from USM cameras
	  (already tested with my Dynax 5D)...
	  - Find the right (and simple) way to get EXIF/IPTC metada from
	  TIFF/EP file like libJpeg can provide (using a simple ByteArray
	  copy). If there is a TIFF _GURU_ in this room, any help welcome
	  !!!
	  - Add TIFF file format in these metadata backup workflows.

	  code from loadsavethread.cpp, split declaration from definition.
	  What was once meant as very lightweight container classes grew
	  into
	  full-blown implementations, so this split was overdue
	  - created managedloadsavethread.cpp and sharedloadsavethread.cpp,
	  moved code from
	  loadsavethread.cpp. This depended on the Load/SaveTask code.
	  - being a bit paranoid, fix a possible race condition where the
	  Load/Save event
	  might not be delivered after the second call of the load/save
	  function with
	  the same file
	  - a SharedLoadingTask now removes itself properly as a listener
	  from itself
	  as a loading process, so that the waiting loop breaks. This was a
	  severe bug
	  but had almost no visible consequences.
	  - add destruction of cache at program exit
	  
	  HistogramWidget:
	  - Loading can now be fast. So avoid flicker.
	  In HistogramWidget, the repainting timer is now restarted to draw
	  calculation
	  message if it is not already running to draw loading message.
	  Previously,

	  - add SharedLoadSaveThread class
	  - split declarations to different header files
	  - add LoadingCache class
	  - sharing of loading processes: if an image is currently being
	  loaded in another
	  SharedLoadSaveThread, a second thread will wait for the first to
	  finish
	  instead of loading it twice
	  - caching of images: loaded images are cached and available to
	  subsequent requests
	  This should eliminate any unnecessary work.
	  - Histogram tab
	  - adapt to shared loading
	  - remove some repaints
	  - painting progress message only after timeout value (100 ms),
	  much snappier now
	  - fixed display of loading failure
	  - Image Editor and Showfoto
	  - adapt DImgInterface to threaded image loading
	  - add appropriate signals and slots to all three layers
	  (DImgInterface, Canvas, ImageWindow and Showfoto)
	  - split loading and saving functions in two parts in all three
	  layers
	  - for saving, some information needs to be stored across
	  asynchronous calls which
	  was previously stored in local variables.
	  Added appropriate members respectively SavingContext classes (in
	  ImageWindow, Showfoto).
	  - put in hooks for progress info display
	  - added preliminary code to wait on asynchronous saving, needed
	  for promptUserSave()
	  - added a modal progress dialog
	  - needs to be tested and fixed, see TODO below
	  - fix creation of ImageWindow singleton upon exiting
	  (checking for imageWindow() would create the instance if not yet
	  done)
	  
	  TODO:
	  - add progress display to status bar
	  - disable actions when saving (all actions?) and loading (not all
	  actions,
	  e.g. selecting another image must be possible and abort loading)
	  - test, think about and fix waiting on save() in promptUserSave()
	  - more thorough testing
	  - fix a bug when fast switching through list in IE. First add
	  disabling of actions.
	  - still some debug statements active

	  Digikam from trunk : and finally RAW file decoding settings are
	  now used by IE and Showfoto...
	  
	  Actually, the RAW file decoding settings implementation provide
	  these parameters :
	  
	  - Enable Quality Decoding (bool) : If disable, we using old dcraw
	  command line syntax with '-q' parameter alone. If Enable we using
	  addition quality factor require by last dcraw release.
	  - Quality Decoding Factor (int 0-4) : The famous factor using to
	  optimize RAW decoding image (0 for slow computer, 3 for speed
	  computer)
	  
	  TO DIGIKAM TEAM :
	  
	  - I have tested using this implementation using dcraw v7.49, not
	  the last one released by Dave Coffin.
	  - We can add any other advanced RAW decoding parameter on
	  settings dialog tab :
	  * -f : Interpolate RGB as four colors. This blurs the image a
	  little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns.
	  * -a : Automatic color balance. The default is to use a fixed
	  color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.
	  * -w : Use the color balance specified by the camera. If this
	  can't be found, dcraw prints a warning and reverts to the
	  default.
	  * -n : By default, dcraw clips all colors to prevent pink hues in
	  the highlights. Combine this option with -b 0.25 to leave the
	  image data completely unclipped.
	  * -j : For Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45
	  degrees so that each output pixel corresponds to one raw pixel.
	  * -s : For Fuji Super CCD SR cameras, use the secondary sensors,
	  in effect underexposing the image by four stops to reveal detail
	  in the highlights. For all other cameras, -j and -s are silently
	  ignored.
	  
	  Notes :
	  
	  - "-a" and "-w" are always actually enable on the current
	  implementation and work fine. I'm not sure if ti's a good idea to
	  disable these parameters.
	  - I have never tested "-f" parameter. I think this one must be
	  availabe in setup.
	  - "-n", "-j", and "-s" are indeep settings. i'm not favorable to
	  add these options, excepted if any users want these parameters...
	  
	  Please let's me hear if all is right for you ! Suggestions and
	  wishes are welcome

	  Big changes in digiKam.
	  This is the new code dedicaced to 0.9.0 unstable developement
	  branch!!!
	  digiKam users, please take a care...
	  
	  Core:
	  
	  ==> New image properties sidebar implementation to display exif,
	  histogram, and image comments & tags to the left of windows using
	  sidebar.
	  This way remove all image properties dialogs and reduce main
	  contextual popup menu (BUG 109096, 109817, 109992, 113103).
	  
	  ==> New DImg framework to work "à la QImage" with image in 8/16
	  bits/color/pixel(BUG 103176).
	  The code is based on incomplete DImage implementation from Renchi
	  Raju. I had fixed and improved this one.
	  Native file formats implemented are JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW (dcraw),
	  PPM.
	  ICC profils and Meta-data are preserved. lcms is used to manage
	  colors rendering manually or automaticly (BUG 87823).
	  Now, There is a new digiKam depency with lcms.
	  
	  Showfoto:
	  
	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - All images from a folder can be loaded at the same time.
	  - Add DImg support.
	  - Thumbbar moved to the left. Image properties side bar to the
	  right to make a consistant GUI with digikam window.
	  
	  Image Editor:
	  
	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - Add DImg support.
	  
	  PENDING TASK:
	  
	  - DImg : add cache file method to improve loading operations.
	  - DImg : add metadata transfert rules between file formats.
	  - DImg : add native support of JPEG2000, OpenEXR, and Krita file
	  formats.
	  - DImg : add rules to detect camera type use to take a photo and
	  applying automaticly an ICC profil (RAW file formats especially).
	  - DImg : add Load/save operation in separed thread to unfreeze
	  GUI.
	  - Image Editor : add progress bar during load/save operation
	  (depending of precedent point)
	  - Image Editor : add Events support between IE and main window
	  about comments & tag sidebar
	  - Core : porting all imageplugins to DImg and support 16 bits
	  images (actually only BCG tool is ported).
	  - Core : porting all image filters to 16 bits (histogram, curves,
	  color effects, etc.)
	  - Core : Saving digiKam comments in PNG & TIFF files like JPEG.
	  - Core : Removed imlib2 depency.
	  - Setup : add new configuration dialog tab to set ICC profils
	  management.
	  - DigikamImagePlugins : porting all plugins to DImg and support
	  16 bits images. All plugins work fine in 8 bits.
	  - DigikamImagePlugins : add new plugin to apply manually an ICC
	  profil.
	  
	  All contributors welcome to finalize digiKam 0.9.0...
	  
	  CCBUGS: 87823, 103176, 109096, 109817, 109992, 113103

	  - always update properly thumbnails after image save/saveas.
	  - improve thumnails computation speed, especially with PNG and
	  JPEG files.
	  - digikamthumbnail protocol will render properly PNG, TIFF, and
	  JPEG files preview in all case (KIO::filePreview can't do it).
	  
	  If showfoto is installed without digikam (digikamthumbnail
	  protocol unavialable), showfoto thumbar use KIO::filePreview
	  protocol instead to rendering thumbnails.

	  This fix makes it possible to delete folders with subfolders in
	  it. Which is broken in beta1. The routines which ask for
	  confirmation if it is ok to delete a folder which has subfolder
	  is a warningYesNo and the routine without subfolders is a
	  warningContinueCancel. Both are handled by an if statement wich
	  check for Continue. Obviously this breaks deletion of a folder
	  with subfolder. For now I'll revert Stephan Binners style change
	  here. Stephan, what is the best way for both dialogs? yes/no or
	  continue/cancel as they have to be equal?

	  Patch from Owen Hirst to fix crash when histogram is visible.
	  
	  The histogram thread holds a pointer to the image data. Under
	  certain
	  conditions, for eg, saving of image and reloading of image data,
	  this image
	  data pointer is invalidated. Since the thread still holds a
	  pointer to the
	  invalid pointer and tries to do calculations on it, the
	  application crashes.
	  Attached patch deletes the histogram thread before reloading the
	  image

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/digikam/iconitem.cpp,
	  trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/digikam/iconitem.h: subtle bug.
	  iconitem used update instead of repaint,
	  this would cause the repaints to be not immediate and as
	  a result an iconitem might still be marked as dirty even
	  though a thumbnail has been generated for it. so when
	  pixmapmanager asked for next item for thumbnailing, the
	  same item was returned again. but there is already a pixmap
	  for it in the cache and so the thumbnailing process stopped.
	  thanks to tom for reporting this.

	  to use without success QPainter::setPen(Qt::MPenStyle) to define
	  a personal pen mask and change it at QObject::timerEvent().
	  
	  Any suggestions ?

	* trunk/kdeextragear-3/digikam/digikam/albumpropsedit.cpp: While
	  porting this function to the experimental branch, I ran into this
	  bug in the logica. When you are young, you make stupid mistakes.
	  Calculation of the average date in an album is based on the
	  difference in days to the first image. When calculating the
	  average date of an album, you can not use abs(), because that
	  will ignore a negative difference.

	* trunk/kdeextragear-3/digikam/Makefile.am: [Damn -m automatism]
	  Anyway, this is adding the beginning
	  of Doxygen support for digikam. The things to remember are:
	  
	  1) The Makefile.am must include the Doxy bla-bla
	  2) Each file to document must have a /** @file Foo */ header
	  3) You _must_ document a surrounding { file, namespace, class }
	  for the documentation of inner things (ie. member functions)
	  to be visible, so document everything.

	  a big tile size. at most 20 tiles are cached at one
	  time.
	  - tile updating and painting is done on demand - expose,
	  paint, cache
	  - fixes glitches in the painting

	* trunk/kdeextragear-3/digikam/digikam/albumiconview.cpp: * Added
	  an item ("Set as Album Thumbnail") to the context menu in the
	  thumbnail
	  view to select a particular image as the album thumbnail - to let
	  the user choose
	  his own thumbnails for the albums.
	  
	  * Furthermore I've changed the album thumbnail creation
	  completely. The image path,
	  from which the album thumbnail was created is now stored in the
	  digikam database.
	  
	  To create these new album icons, the user has to browse through
	  his albums. The
	  first readable image will be used as the default icon. Then he
	  can change the
	  album thumbnail to an images he likes (with the context menu as
	  described above).
	  This is not the best solution to create the new thumbnails, but
	  we decided not to
	  add too much special code to the application which is only needed
	  for the first
	  run after an upgrade.
	  
	  * ToDo: the same for the tag icons

	  building
	  the album list manually and then querying items from the tag
	  table alone,
	  the queries are much faster (nearly 10x speed increase).
	  consequently
	  listing of items from the tags has a >2x speed increase (stating
	  and
	  listentry slow things down).

	  Waiting-for-your-backtraces AKA first-steps-to-0.7 commit
	  
	  Large number of changes:
	  a) interfaces subdirectory removed. some of the code moved to
	  digikam subdir
	  b) sqlite source code (v2.8.14) imported into a separate subdir
	  c) AlbumManager/AlbumDB/Album (note: change in name from
	  AlbumInfo->Album)
	  rewritten from scratch
	  d) AlbumDB is the new sqlite based database backend instead of
	  the old xml
	  style database. Old xml database will be imported automatically
	  into
	  the new database. No export function yet (do we still need a
	  separate
	  digikam xml format? we can think of exporting to some other app
	  format,
	  like kimdaba/kphotobook). Note: the old xml files are still
	  retained,
	  so you can safely run this new digikam on your existing album
	  library.
	  e) Album is an abstract class with derived implementations of two
	  (currently)
	  kinds: Physical Albums (PAlbum) - representing folders on the
	  drive and
	  Tag Album (TAlbum) - representing tags in the database
	  f) Nested albums supported (some optimization might be needed for
	  loading
	  the initial list of physical albums). both folders and tags can
	  have
	  unlimited nesting
	  g) Native light-weight implementation of a treeview to replace
	  qlistview
	  based treeview. this new implementation is flicker-free and has a
	  cleaner
	  look compared to qlistview
	  h) Tagging of images added (you must have guessed it from the
	  above statements).
	  Tags are shown as "albums" under a subtree of the treeview on the
	  left.
	  Tagging can be done individually for an image using a dialog
	  (enhanced version
	  of the old comments dialog) or in bulk by selecting a bunch of
	  images and
	  dragging and dropping on a tag.
	  i) rewrite of the painting routines by getting information from
	  the database
	  diretly instead of loading it into memory. thumbnail items have a
	  fixed
	  grid size and text not fitting into the grid will be shown
	  truncated with dots.
	  (need to add a tooltip for this)
	  f) extra information that can be shown in the thumbnail view:
	  name (yes, name is hideable), date, file size, resolution,
	  comments,
	  jpeg comments, tags. removed items: Exif comments and mimetype
	  g) lots more. i will add them to the ChangeLog as and when i
	  remember them
	  
	  Caveats:
	  a) KIPI interface is commented out. A port to the new digikam
	  classes will
	  need to be done. So no kipi plugins will be loaded
	  b) Camera Client disabled (won't be compiled). A custom folder
	  selection/creation dialog is needed before it can be enabled
	  again.
	  c) There might (very likely) be regressions. Polishing is need on
	  a lot
	  of aspects.
	  c) this is a massive upgrade. so things are bound to have broken.
	  Testing
	  is requested.

	  1) Zooming should be much faster (and use considerably less
	  memory at
	  large zooms). rendering done in two phases: a sub-super-pixel
	  sampled
	  scaled one first and with a qtimer timeout an antialiased scaled
	  one.
	  we take advantage of imlib2 speed (and cache use) and render from
	  image
	  to pixmap for every repaint. only exposed area is rendered unlike
	  previously where the entire image was rendered to a cached
	  pixmap.
	  
	  2) fix 2 of the bugs reported by Mikolaj Machowski:
	  a) space between resolution and "pixels"
	  b) imageviewer being pushed back behind main app when a plugin
	  dialog opens

	  New features:

	  2) new gui - based on qmainwindow with menubar and toolbar
	  3) plugin interface so that image editor plugins can be written

	  reasons.
	  5) new selection method
	  6) new resize image option
	  
	  caveats:
	  1) save and save as functions not yet implemented (not
	  necessarily bad, as user
	  can fool around with the imageeditor without risk of losing
	  anything)
	  2) exif restorer needs to be added (linked to 1 above)

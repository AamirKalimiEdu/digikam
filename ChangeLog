        * Added Czech and Hungarian i18n.
        * Removed jpeglossless code from main application. Moved to a plugin

          problems with the threaded version and some qt/kde versions.
        * Drag and drop copy/move of images between albums will also copy/move
          comments. these use wrappers around kde kio classes to move/copy 
          comments along with the files
        * Plugins can merge their actions into the right-click menu of the
          thumbnailview by just adding "X-Digikam-MergeMenu=true" in their
          desktop file
        * Removed a source of flicker in the albumiconview
        * Thumbnail Generator added to interfaces. more robust (with
          jpeg error checking - thanks to Marcus Meissner) and simpler to
          use (using signals/slots). Provides a non-blocking thumbnail
          generation interface compliant with freedesktop.org
          standards (which is used by the main application and also can be
          used by any of the plugins).
        * Now instead of download to directory in the cameraclient, we
          have download to album. also new albums can be created directly
          from the cameraclient.

        * Fixed a bug in Album::getPath() API plugins implementation.
        * Plugins can refresh the view if they change the comments of the items.
        * Now, the album library is the only place where you add or delete albums.
        * All the information for an album (collection,date,comments) and for the
          items in the album (currently only comments) are stored in a single xml
          file ( called digikam.xml ) inside the album itself.
        * Now albums are directly detected in the album library path, no need
          for manual addition and deletion.
        * The comments.xml file has been changed to digikam.xml and its format
          also has changed.

Resume :
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Digikam is a kde application which acts as a frontend to gphoto2 for
communicating with your digital camera and download pictures from
it. I was never able to get kamera working properly with my Canon
PowerShot A20 and couldn't find any other good frontend for
gphoto2. So digikam was born. It should be able to communicate with
your camera and preview images and download pictures.  It is also able
to autodetect the camera connected to the computer.

digikam is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
